## Migration Guide

### From Version 1.0.0 to 1.0.1

#### No Breaking Changes
This is a **minor version update** with **no breaking changes**. All existing integrations will continue to work without modification.

#### Optional Enhancements

1. **Leverage New Functions**:
   ```typescript
   // Listen to customer creation events
   exports.onCustomerCreatedTrigger = functions.firestore
     .document('customers/{uid}')
     .onCreate(async (snap, context) => {
       // Custom logic for new customers
       console.log('New customer created:', context.params.uid);
     });
   ```

2. **Use Preferred Locales**:
   ```typescript
   // Set customer preferred locales during creation
   await db.collection('customers').doc(userId).set({
     email: 'user@example.com',
     preferred_locales: ['en-US', 'es-ES']
   }, { merge: true });
   ```

3. **Monitor Statistics**:
   ```typescript
   // Query updated statistics
   const stats = await db.collection('configuration').doc('stats').get();
   console.log('Total customers:', stats.data()?.customerCount);
   console.log('Active subscriptions:', stats.data()?.subscriptionCount);
   ```

## Testing Recommendations
